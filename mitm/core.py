class Host:
    """
    Dataclass representing an `mitm` host.

    A host is a pair of `asyncio.StreamReader` and `asyncio.StreamWriter` objects
    that are used to communicate with the remote host. There are two types of hosts: a
    client, and a server. A client host is one that is connected to the `mitm`, and a
    server host is one that the `mitm` connected to on behalf of the client.

    The `mitm_managed` attribute is used to determine whether the `mitm` is responsible
    for closing the connection with the host. If `mitm_managed` is True, the `mitm` will
    close the connection with the host when it is done with it. If `mitm_managed` is set
    to False, the `mitm` will not close the connection with the host, and instead, the
    developer must close the connection with the host manually. This is useful for
    situations where the `mitm` is running as a seperate utility and the developer
    wants to keep the connection open with the host after the `mitm` is done with it.

    Note:
        See more on `dataclasses <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_.

    Args:
        reader: The reader of the host.

        mitm_managed: Whether or not the host is managed by the `mitm`.
        ip: The IP address of the host.
